A 42 school project that simulates the classic "Dining Philosophers Problem," focusing on multithreading and synchronization. Each philosopher alternates between eating, thinking, and sleeping, using shared resources (forks) while avoiding deadlocks and race conditions.
Takes number of philosophers, time to die, time to eat, time to sleep, and optionally a number of times each philosopher needs to eat before the simulation ends as arguments.

usage:
./philo <number of philosophers> <time to die> <time to eat> <time to sleep>

or:
./philo <number of philosophers> <time to die> <time to eat> <time to sleep> <times to eat>
